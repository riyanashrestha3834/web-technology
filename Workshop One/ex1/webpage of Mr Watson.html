<h1>Thomas J. Watson Sr.</h1>
<P>Thomas J. Watson is a pioneer in the development of accounting and computing 
    equipment used today by business, government, science and industry.
     Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874.He built a worldwide industry during his 42 years at IBM.
     He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines.
         IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States.
          Watson built IBM into such a dominant company that the federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952.
           IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States at the time. In 1956, IBM's revenues were $897 million, and the company had 72,500 employees.</P>

            <li><b>Personal Life</b></li>
            Thomas J. Watson is the fifth child and only son of Thomas and Jane Fulton White Watson.
             His four older siblings were Jennie, Effie, Loua, and Emma. His father farmed and owned a modest lumber business located near Painted Post, a few miles west of Corning, in the Southern Tier region of New York.
              Thomas worked on the family farm in East Campbell, New York and attended the District School Number Five in the late 1870s.
             As Watson entered his teen years he attended Addison Academy In Addison, New York. He left the school in 1891, taking a job at $6 a week as bookkeeper for Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post.
              One year later he joined a traveling salesman, George Cornwell, peddling organs and pianos around the farms for William Bronson's local hardware store, Watson's first sales job.
              When Cornwell left, Watson continued alone, earning $10 per week. After two years of this life, he realized he would be earning $70 per week if he were on a commission.
               His indignation on making this discovery was such that he quit and moved from his familiar surroundings to the relative metropolis of Buffalo.
               Watson's next job was peddling shares of the Buffalo Building and Loan Company.Next Watson opened a butcher shop in Buffalo, which soon failed, leaving Watson with no money, no investment, and no job. 
               Later, Watson married Jeanette Kittredge, from a prominent Dayton, Ohio railroad family, on April 17, 1913. They had two sons and two daughters.
<li><b>Career</b></li>
Having given up his first job—teaching—after just one day, Watson took a year's course in accounting and business at the Miller School of Commerce in Elmira, New York.
He started earning money by selling newspapers from $10 per week to $70 per week.
His indignation on making this discovery was such that he quit and moved from his familiar surroundings to the relative metropolis of Buffalo.
Watson even sold sewing machines for Wheeler and Wilson, however, got fired for loss and damage of property.
Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.:This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to the tens of thousands of people who had to follow his rules.
Watson had a newly acquired NCR cash register in his butcher shop, for which he had to arrange transfer of the installment payments to the new owner of the butcher shop. On visiting NCR, he met John J. Range and asked him for a job.
 Determined to join the company, he repeatedly called on Range until, after a number of abortive attempts, he finally was hired in November 1896, as sales apprentice to Range.
 Then he became the most successful salesman in the East, earning $100 per week.
Four years later, NCR assigned Watson to run the struggling NCR agency in Rochester, New York. As an agent, he got 35% commission and reported directly to Hugh Chalmers, the second-in-command at NCR.
<li><b>Head of IBM</b></li>
Charles Ranlett Flint, who had engineered the amalgamation (via stock acquisition) forming the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) found it difficult to manage the five companies.
 He hired Watson as general manager on May 1, 1914, when the five companies had about 1,300 employees. 
Eleven months later he was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.
Within four years revenues had been doubled to $9 million. In 1924, he renamed CTR to International Business Machines. Watson built IBM into such a dominant company that the federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952. IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States at the time.
Watson maintained a deep interest in international relations, from both a diplomatic and a business perspective. He was known as US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unofficial ambassador in New York and often entertained foreign statesmen.
 In 1937, he was elected president of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and at that year's biennial congress in Berlin stated that the conference keynote would be "World Peace Through World Trade.
 That phrase became the slogan of both the ICC and IBM.
            <li><b>Secret Behind Success of IBM</b></li>
IBM has been one of the leading names among computing giants, dominating the early global market with technical and service superiority, computation and tabulation machines, and victory in lucrative defense contracts.
However, IBM success was also the result of a devoted labor base and progressive corporate culture well ahead of its time.
The chairman and CEO Thomas J. Watson, Sr., this culture emphasized a “family” atmosphere at IBM with Watson as father figure and provider for his employees.
In the years following the Great Depression, IBM did very well compared to other companies after a wave of layoffs in 1932. That is because IBM was a big winner for government contracts.
IBM was able to garner enormous data processing contracts for the Social Security program, providing the company with a windfall that allowed finally implementing welfare capitalist measures, such as air-conditioned production facilities, the replacement of the piecework system with hourly wages, paid holidays for all employees, and life, accident, and family hospitalization insurance. In return, the company expected employees to refrain from organizing in unions during a decade rife with union-friendly politics and organization drives.
After WWII when IBM reorganized its foreign operations in a wholly owned subsidiary, Watson wife, Jeanette, became the only woman on the board of trustees — a rare achievement even by todays standards. Her presence, which some historians argue was mostly symbolic, helped soften Watson role as CEO.
Watson made personal interaction with his employees and generous compensation packages top priorities. Like several large companies at the time, IBM gave its employees a wealth of benefits as long as they refused to join labor unions.
He achieved a modified form of success in using this same strategy among the conservative, yet union-connected, employees in Germany. While employees in the West German plant reacted favorably to Watson beneficence and emphasis on paternal care, they still insisted on the right to form and join unions.
In the battle against unions, Watson image as a caring father stood in stark contrast to the typically antagonistic nature of labor relations in West Germany. It also worked in favor of IBM.
IBM executives and employees embraced welfare capitalist benefits although they continued to organize in national labor unions, formed a works council, and elected an employee representative to the board of directors. Yet, the sense of belonging to the IBM family created a loyalty that made IBM employees strike-adverse and led them to accept labor measures that threatened to break up labor solidarity.
IBM was able to lure the most talented employees with its higher wages and welfare capitalist measures.
With the compay foreign profits surpassing its domestic profits by the early 1970s, attracting and maintaining a suitable workforce abroad was an important factor contributing to success of the company.
