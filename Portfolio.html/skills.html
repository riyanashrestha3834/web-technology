                <p>I have been actively learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I have been able to put my skills into practice by building a website. My HTML skills allow me to create well-structured and semantic web pages that are optimized for accessibility and search engines. I am proficient in using CSS to add style and visual appeal to my web pages and I am able to create responsive designs that look great on any device. I believe that my passion for web development, combined with my technical skills and problem-solving abilities, make me a strong candidate for any web development opportunity. </p>
